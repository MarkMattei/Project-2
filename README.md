# Project-2
Mobile Robot for MEC830


Task 1: Manually control the robot to navigate from start to end

Task 2: Program the robot to autonomously navigate from p0 to p3. The use of sensors and
actuators is left for you as a design problem.

Task 3: Navigate autonomously from A to B avoiding the obstacle. The position of the obstacle
is not fixed, but during the navigation, it is stationary. Your performance is measured in terms
of navigation speed and also the distance from B when you get to the finish line

Task 4: Program the robot to autonomously navigate a square, from p0 to p1, p1 to p2, p2 to
p3, and finally from p3 to p0. Attach a pen/marker to the robot and trace the trajectory of the
robot. Determine the endpoint of the trajectory
